# OS Concept 

- **Types of kernel**
    - **Monolithic kernel: speed!**
        - E.x. Unix, Linux, BSD, Multics
        - All OS services operate in kernel space
            - Provides scheduling, file management through sys calls
        - Pros
            - **Performance**: communication between components is fast and efficient!
              - Generally faster in terms of performance because system calls and inter-process communication (IPC) do not require context switching between user space and kernel space. Direct function calls within the kernel are quicker than message passing used in microkernels.
        - Cons
            - Complexity: huge
            - Poor maintainability: hard to debug and maintain
            - Poor reliability: if any service fails, system failure. A bug in one component can crash the whole system. 

- **Microkernel**: **modularity and reliability**
    - E.x. L4
    - Minimalistic approach
        - Kernel only keep: **basic IPC, virtual memory, scheduling**
          - **Exokernel**: only exposes resources.
          - Microkernel: mostly consists of IPC (Interprocess communication)
            - Services (like FS, Processes, even user progrmas) communicates to the microkernel through IPC. **Require context switching**. 
        - Put other services run in user space
            - Libraries running on user space
            - E.x. device drivers, networking, file system, etc.
        - Communication between components is provided by IPC (i.e. applications R/W through IPC)
          - **IPC is slower than function calls in monolithic kernel.**
    - Pros
        - Scalability: kernel smaller, separation of services at separate layers
        - Extensibility: new services can be easily added
        - Easy maintenance and debugging
        - More secure and reliable: a single service faults not lead to failures
    - Cons
        - Bad performance: lots of system calls (i.e. IPC) and context switches

- **Hybrid kernel**
    - E.x. Windows, Android
        - MacOS (BSD Unix + Mach): monolithic on top of microkernel. Hybrid kernel. 
    - Combine best of both worlds
        - Speed and simple design of a monolithic kernel
        - Modularity and stability of a microkernel
        - User-mode services: Some components, such as  subsystems (e.g., user-mode drivers and environment subsystems like the Windows Subsystem for Linux), run in user space. This separation helps improve system robustness and security.
    - Pros: still similar to monolithic kernel
        - With disadvantages similar

- **Exokernel**
    - Follow end-to-end principals
        - Extremely minimal: extreme version of microkernel
        - Fewest hardware abstractions as possible
        - Just allocates **physical resources** to apps
    - Pros: minimal and simple
    - Cons
        - More work for application developer
        - Poor isolation: each application implements own LibOS
            - Libraries accessing directly the HW, donâ€™t have isolations
        - Hardware compatibility: need to change LibOS depending on HW interfaces

- **Unikernel** = Exokernel + Containers
    - Goal: link application with just enough OS functionality to allow it to execute
        * Instead of OS on top of VMM, use simple library kernel that get's optimized into a application specific binary
        * **Dead code elimination** so code size is smaller and simpler
        * Strongly typed library OS leads to fewer bugs and increased security
        * Faster overall since system calls become procedure calls over the VMM abstraction
          * **Instead of invoking a system call that switches to kernel mode, the application directly calls the corresponding function in the unikernel.** No context switching. 
        * Single address space. 
        * Result: faster OS with less code and 50ms boot times
    - Key idea: run one application per VM, one process per application
        - Everything compiled into a VM image
    - Pros
        - extremely lightweight (~MB), tailored to perform just one specific application
        - customizable
        - better isolation
    - Cons
        - Recompile, and each libraries are untrusted
