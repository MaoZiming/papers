”THE” Multiprogramming System was an operating system developed by Dijkstra. The operating system was designed to be a single user while executing concurrent programs. 

* Pages and segments.

> Therefore we have arranged the whole system as a society of sequential processes, progressing with un- defined speed ratios.

Three contributions:
1. A demonstration of the concept of software layering and how it leads to better verification and testing of a system.
2. The idea of software page-based virtual memory.
3. The idea of semaphore for use in concurrency.


_Key Techniques_: Layering of system components, process scheduling, and semaphores for IPC.
