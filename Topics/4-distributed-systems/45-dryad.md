# Dryad: Distributed Data-Parallel Programs from Sequential Building Blocks

Read: July 3rd, 2024

Dryad is designed to allow developers to build distributed data-parallel programs using sequential programming constructs. Dryad represents data-parallel computations as **directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)**, and the runtime dynamically optimizes execution plans based on available resources and other factors. This approach allows for a flexible and powerful programming model that can be optimized at runtime.

> The Dryad project addresses a long-standing problem: how can we make it easier for developers to write efficient parallel and distributed applications?

## Summary:

- On a very high level, Dryad focuses more on simplicity of the programming model and reliability, efficiency and scalability of the application. It provides task scheduling, concurrency optimization, fault tolerance and data distribution. One of the unique feature provided by Dryad is the flexibility of fine-grained control of an application's data flow graph.

- A job in Dryad is a directed acyclic graph where each vertex is an executable program and edges represent data channels (e.g. files, TCP pipes, and shared memory FIFOs.). The job manager contains the application-specific code to construct the jobâ€™s communication graph along with library code to schedule the work across the available resources. To discover available resources, each computer in the cluster has a proxy daemon running, and they are registered into a central name server, the job manager queries the name server to get available computers.

- Authors designed a simple graph description language that empowers the developer with explicit graph construction and refinement to fully take advantage of the rich features of the Dryad execution engine.

- Another important design in Dryad is that each vertex belongs to a "stage", and each stage has a stage manager that receives a callback on every state transition of a vertex execution in that stage. The stage manager is used to achieve max locality, do dynamic graph refinements.

- In Dryad, a scheduler inside job manager tracks states of each vertex. The vertices **report status and errors** to the Job manager, and the progress of channels is automatically monitored. When a vertex execution fails for any reason, the vertex will be re-ran, but with different version numbers.

## Note:

- Partitioned distributed files: Input file expands to set of vertices, where each partition is one virtual vertex. 
- Why no cycles: Making scheduling easier! Vertex can run anywhere once all its inputs are ready and Directed-Acyclic means there is no deadlock. And Making fault-tolerance easier (with deterministic code): If A fails, run it again. If A's inputs are gone, run upstream vertices again. If A is slow, run another copy elsewhere and use output from whichever finishes first.

## Mapreduce versus Dryad: 
- I think we can view Dryad as a general version of Mapreduce. First, computations in Dryad are not limited to just map and reduce but are expressed as DAGs. Second, Dryad allows communication between stages to happen over not just files stored in disk: it allows for files, TCP pipes and shared memory. Lastly, in Dryad, each vertex can take n inputs and produce n outputs, but, in Mapreduce, map only takes one input and generate one output.
- In general, Dryad has a number of benefits: more efficient communication, the ability to chain together multiple stages, and express more complicated computation.

## Limitations:

- I think it's not so simple to write programs in Dryad as you have to learn a new domain-specific language. 
  - > In order to get the best performance from a native Dryad application, the developer must understand the struc- ture of the computation and the organization and properties of the system resources.
- No cycles are allowed in Dryad computation. 
- Only one job can run at a time. 
- As a final note, programmers aren't really meant to write program to interact with Dryad directly, but instead they are supposed to use things like DryadLINQ. This is also true for Mapreduce. FlumeJava has been heavily used at Google as an internal tool. Hive, Pig and Mahout are popular tools built on top of Hadoop.
