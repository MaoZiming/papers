# Address Translation

- Virtualizing memory: **hardware-based address translation**

  - Hardware transforms each memory access (e.g. instruction fetch, load, or store), changing the **virtual address** provided by the instruction to a **physical address** where the desired information is actually located
- Dynamic (Hardware-based) Relocation, or Base and Bounds

  - "Dynamic relocation": relocation of the address happens at runtime
  - Need two hardware registers within each CPU
    - Hardware structures kept on the chip (one pair per CPU)
      - The part that helps with address translation: **memory management unit (MMU)**
    - **Base** register: Translation
    - **Bounds** (or limit) register
      - Protection: “size” of the address space, and physical address of the end of address space
    - **Base and bounds**
      - Place the address space anywhere we like in physical memory
      - While ensure each process can only access its own address space
  - Memory reference is translated by the processor in this manner: `physical address = virtual address + base`
  - CPU is able to generate exceptions when user program tries to access memory illegally —> arrange for OS exception handler to run
    - in this case, the CPU should stop executing the user program and arrange for the OS “out-of-bounds” exception handler to run.
    - Similarly, if a user program tries to change the values of the (privileged) base and bounds registers, the CPU should raise an exception and run the “tried to execute a privileged operation while in user mode” handler. These instructions require kernel (privileged) mode.
  - When a new process is created, the OS will have to search a data structure (often called a **free list**) to find room for the new address space and then mark it used.
  - The OS must save and restore the base-and-bounds pair when it switches between processes.
    - In some per-process structure such as process control block (PCB).
    - To move a process’s address space, the OS first deschedules the process; then, the OS copies the address space from the current location to the new location; finally, the OS updates the saved base register (in the process structure) to point to the new location.
- Some inefficiency of base-and-bounds

  - **Internal fragmentation** (space inside the allocated unit is not all used)

    - restricted to placing an address space in a fixed-sized slot and thus internal fragmentation can arise
  - Slight generalization of base and bounds: segmentation (next)
