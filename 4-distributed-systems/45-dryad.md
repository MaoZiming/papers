Dryad is designed to allow developers to build distributed data-parallel programs as **directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)**, and the runtime dynamically optimizes execution plans based on available resources and other factors. 

> The Dryad project addresses a long-standing problem: how can we make it easier for developers to write efficient parallel and distributed applications?

## Summary:

- A job in Dryad is a DAG where each vertex is an executable program and edges represent data channels (e.g. files, TCP pipes, and shared memory FIFOs.). 
- The job manager contains the application-specific code to construct the jobâ€™s communication graph along with library code to schedule the work across the available resources. 
- To discover available resources, each computer in the cluster has a proxy daemon running, and they are registered into a central name server, the job manager queries the name server to get available computers.

- Authors designed a simple graph description language that empowers the developer with explicit graph construction and refinement to fully take advantage of the rich features of the Dryad execution engine.

- Another important design in Dryad is that each vertex belongs to a "stage", and each stage has a **stage manager** that receives a callback on every state transition of a vertex execution in that stage.

- In Dryad, a scheduler inside **job manager** tracks states of each vertex. The vertices **report status and errors** to the Job manager, and the progress of channels is automatically monitored. When a vertex execution fails for any reason, the vertex will be re-ran, but with different version numbers.

- The DryadLINQ system automatically and transparently translates the data-parallel portions of the program into a distributed execution plan which is passed to the Dryad execution platform.

## Note:

- Partitioned distributed files: Input file expands to set of vertices, where each partition is one virtual vertex. 
- Why no cycles: Making scheduling easier! Vertex can run anywhere once all its inputs are ready and Directed-Acyclic means there is no deadlock. 
  -  Making fault-tolerance easier (with deterministic code): If A fails, run it again. If A's inputs are gone, run upstream vertices again. If A is slow, run another copy elsewhere and use output from whichever finishes first.

## Mapreduce versus Dryad: 
- I think we can view Dryad as a general version of Mapreduce. First, computations in Dryad are not limited to just map and reduce but are expressed as DAGs. Second, Dryad allows communication between stages to happen over not just files stored in disk: it allows for **files, TCP pipes and shared memory**. Lastly, in Dryad, each vertex can take $n$ inputs and produce $n$ outputs, but, in Mapreduce, map only takes one input and generate one output.
- In general, Dryad has a number of benefits: more efficient communication, the ability to chain together multiple stages, and express more complicated computation.

## Limitations:

- I think it's not so simple to write programs in Dryad as you have to learn a new domain-specific language. 
  - > In order to get the best performance from a native Dryad application, the developer must understand the structure of the computation and the organization and properties of the system resources.
- No cycles are allowed in Dryad computation. 
- As a final note, programmers aren't really meant to write program to interact with Dryad directly, but instead they are supposed to use things like **DryadLINQ**. This is also true for Mapreduce. FlumeJava has been heavily used at Google as an internal tool. Hive, Pig and Mahout are popular tools built on top of Hadoop.
