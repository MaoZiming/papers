# Little's Law

- Time between successive arrivals is random and memoryless
- The average number of jobs/tasks in the system (N) is equal to mean arrival time (Î») times the response time (L) 
- M/M/1 and M/G/1 queues: simplest to analyze
  - M/M/11 queue: arrivals are determined by Poisson distribution, and job servie time determiend by exponential distribution.
